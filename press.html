Acasta Gneiss<br>
"Glimmer"

</p>

<p>
Iridescence is an optical property where the color of an object
    is determined by the angle of the viewer, often observed in a puddle of an oil spill,
    soap bubbles or the surface of a compact disc. The seven sparse pieces on Acasta Gneissâ€™ Glimmer have a similar quality. Building on repetitive structures these compositions drift in and out of focus, seemingly changing with each iteration. As the album progresses ethereal synth pads are contrasted with recordings inspired by asmr practices, heavily processed using digital techniques. Glimmer offers an immersive, sometimes unnerving, but ultimately hopeful experience, like a faint, wavering light in the distance illuminating the darkness.
</p>
<p>
Glimmer is available on November 26 2023, digitally and on a limited run of 30C cassette tapes. The album will also be available with a limited edition booklet containing additional text and artwork.
